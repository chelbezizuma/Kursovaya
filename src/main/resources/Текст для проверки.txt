BOOK ONE 1805 CHAPTER I quotWell Prince so Genoa and Lucca are now just family estates of the Buonapartes But I warn you if you don039t tell me that this means war if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that Antichrist mdash I really believe he is Antichrist mdash I will have nothing more to do with you and you are no longer my friend no longer my 039faithful slave039 as you call yourself But how do you do I see I have frightened you mdash sit down and tell me all the newsquot It was in July 1805 and the speaker was the wellknown Anna Pavlovna Scherer maid of honor and favorite of the Empress Marya Fedorovna With these words she greeted Prince Vasili Kuragin a man of high rank and importance who was the first to arrive at her reception Anna Pavlovna had had a cough for some days She was as she said suffering from la grippe grippe being then a new word in St Petersburg used only by the elite All her invitations without exception written in French and delivered by a scarletliveried footman that morning ran as follows quotIf you have nothing better to do Count or Prince and if the prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible I shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10 mdash Annette Schererquot quotHeavens what a virulent attackquot replied the prince not in the least disconcerted by this reception He had just entered wearing an embroidered court uniform knee breeches and shoes and had stars on his breast and a serene expression on his flat face He spoke in that refined French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought and with the gentle patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance who had grown old in society and at court He went up to Anna Pavlovna kissed her hand presenting to her his bald scented and shining head and complacently seated himself on the sofa quotFirst of all dear friend tell me how you are Set your friend039s mind at restquot said he without altering his tone beneath the politeness and affected sympathy of which indifference and even irony could be discerned quotCan one be well while suffering morally Can one be calm in times like these if one has any feelingquot said Anna Pavlovna quotYou are staying the whole evening I hopequot quotAnd the fete at the English ambassador039s Today is Wednesday I must put in an appearance therequot said the prince quotMy daughter is coming for me to take me therequot quotI thought today039s fete had been canceled I confess all these festivities and fireworks are becoming wearisomequot quotIf they had known that you wished it the entertainment would have been put offquot said the prince who like a woundup clock by force of habit said things he did not even wish to be believed quotDon039t tease Well and what has been decided about Novosiltsev039s dispatch You know everythingquot quotWhat can one say about itquot replied the prince in a cold listless tone quotWhat has been decided They have decided that Buonaparte has burnt his boats and I believe that we are ready to burn oursquot Prince Vasili always spoke languidly like an actor repeating a stale part Anna Pavlovna Scherer on the contrary despite her forty years overflowed with animation and impulsiveness To be an enthusiast had become her social vocation and sometimes even when she did not feel like it she became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint the expectations of those who knew her The subdued smile which though it did not suit her faded features always played round her lips expressed as in a spoiled child a continual consciousness of her charming defect which she neither wished nor could nor considered it necessary to correct In the midst of a conversation on political matters Anna Pavlovna burst out quotOh don039t speak to me of Austria Perhaps I don039t understand things but Austria never has wished and does not wish for war She is betraying us Russia alone must save Europe Our gracious sovereign recognizes his high vocation and will be true to it That is the one thing I have faith in Our good and wonderful sovereign has to perform the noblest role on earth and he is so virtuous and noble that God will not forsake him He will fulfill his vocation and crush the hydra of revolution which has become more terrible than ever in the person of this murderer and villain We alone must avenge the blood of the just one Whom I ask you can we rely on England with her commercial spirit will not and cannot understand the Emperor Alexander039s loftiness of soul She has refused to evacuate Malta She wanted to find and still seeks some secret motive in our actions What answer did Novosiltsev get None The English have not understood and cannot understand the selfabnegation of our Emperor who wants nothing for himself but only desires the good of mankind And what have they promised Nothing And what little they have promised they will not perform Prussia has always declared that Buonaparte is invincible and that all Europe is powerless before him And I don039t believe a word that Hardenburg says or Haugwitz either This famous Prussian neutrality is just a trap I have faith only in God and the lofty destiny of our adored monarch He will save Europequot She suddenly paused smiling at her own impetuosity quotI thinkquot said the prince with a smile quotthat if you had been sent instead of our dear Wintzingerode you would have captured the King of Prussia039s consent by assault You are so eloquent Will you give me a cup of teaquot quotIn a moment A proposquot she added becoming calm again quotI am expecting two very interesting men tonight le Vicomte de Mortemart who is connected with the Montmorencys through the Rohans one of the best French families He is one of the genuine emigres the good ones And also the Abbe Morio Do you know that profound thinker He has been received by the Emperor Had you heardquot quotI shall be delighted to meet themquot said the prince quotBut tell mequot he added with studied carelessness as if it had only just occurred to him though the question he was about to ask was the chief motive of his visit quotis it true that the Dowager Empress wants Baron Funke to be appointed first secretary at Vienna The baron by all accounts is a poor creaturequot Prince Vasili wished to obtain this post for his son but others were trying through the Dowager Empress Marya Fedorovna to secure it for the baron Anna Pavlovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she nor anyone else had a right to criticize what the Empress desired or was pleased with quotBaron Funke has been recommended to the Dowager Empress by her sisterquot was all she said in a dry and mournful tone As she named the Empress Anna Pavlovna039s face suddenly assumed an expression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled with sadness and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustrious patroness She added that Her Majesty had deigned to show Baron Funke beaucoup d039estime and again her face clouded over with sadness The prince was silent and looked indifferent But with the womanly and courtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her Anna Pavlovna wished both to rebuke him for daring to speak he had done of a man recommended to the Empress and at the same time to console him so she said quotNow about your family Do you know that since your daughter came out everyone has been enraptured by her They say she is amazingly beautifulquot The prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitude quotI often thinkquot she continued after a short pause drawing nearer to the prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that political and social topics were ended and the time had come for intimate conversation mdash quotI often think how unfairly sometimes the joys of life are distributed Why has fate given you two such splendid children I don039t speak of Anatole your youngest I don039t like himquot she added in a tone admitting of no rejoinder and raising her eyebrows quotTwo such charming children And really you appreciate them less than anyone and so you don039t deserve to have themquot And she smiled her ecstatic smile quotI can039t help itquot said the prince quotLavater would have said I lack the bump of paternityquot quotDon039t joke I mean to have a serious talk with you Do you know I am dissatisfied with your younger son Between ourselvesquot and her face assumed its melancholy expression quothe was mentioned at Her Majesty039s and you were pitiedquot The prince answered nothing but she looked at him significantly awaiting a reply He frowned quotWhat would you have me doquot he said at last quotYou know I did all a father could for their education and they have both turned out fools Hippolyte is at least a quiet fool but Anatole is an active one That is the only difference between themquot He said this smiling in a way more natural and animated than usual so that the wrinkles round his mouth very clearly revealed something unexpectedly coarse and unpleasant quotAnd why are children born to such men as you If you were not a father there would be nothing I could reproach you withquot said Anna Pavlovna looking up pensively quotI am your faithful slave and to you alone I can confess that my children are the bane of my life It is the cross I have to bear That is how I explain it to myself It can039t be helpedquot He said no more but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by a gesture Anna Pavlovna meditated quotHave you never thought of marrying your prodigal son Anatolequot she asked quotThey say old maids have a mania for matchmaking and though I don039t feel that weakness in myself as yet I know a little person who is very unhappy with her father She is a relation of yours Princess Mary Bolkonskayaquot Prince Vasili did not reply though with the quickness of memory and perception befitting a man of the world he indicated by a movement of the head that he was considering this information quotDo you knowquot he said at last evidently unable to check the sad current of his thoughts quotthat Anatole is costing me forty thousand rubles a year Andquot he went on after a pause quotwhat will it be in five years if he goes on like thisquot Presently he added quotThat039s what we fathers have to put up with Is this princess of yours richquot quotHer father is very rich and stingy He lives in the country He is the wellknown Prince Bolkonski who had to retire from the army under the late Emperor and was nicknamed 039the King of Prussia039 He is very clever but eccentric and a bore The poor girl is very unhappy She has a brother I think you know him he married Lise Meinen lately He is an aidedecamp of Kutuzov039s and will be here tonightquot quotListen dear Annettequot said the prince suddenly taking Anna Pavlovna039s hand and for some reason drawing it downwards quotArrange that affair for me and I shall always be your most devoted slaveslafe with an f as a village elder of mine writes in his reports She is rich and of good family and that039s all I wantquot And with the familiarity and easy grace peculiar to him he raised the maid of honor039s hand to his lips kissed it and swung it to and fro as he lay back in his armchair looking in another direction quotAttendezquot said Anna Pavlovna reflecting quotI039ll speak to Lise young Bolkonski039s wife this very evening and perhaps the thing can be arranged It shall be on your family039s behalf that I039ll start my apprenticeship as old maidquot CHAPTER II Anna Pavlovna039s drawing room was gradually filling The highest Petersburg society was assembled there people differing widely in age and character but alike in the social circle to which they belonged Prince Vasili039s daughter the beautiful Helene came to take her father to the ambassador039s entertainment she wore a ball dress and her badge as maid of honor The youthful little Princess Bolkonskaya known as la femme la plus seduisante de Petersbourg was also there She had been married during the previous winter and being pregnant did not go to any large gatherings but only to small receptions Prince Vasili039s son Hippolyte had come with Mortemart whom he introduced The Abbe Morio and many others had also come The most fascinating woman in Petersburg To each new arrival Anna Pavlovna said quotYou have not yet seen my auntquot or quotYou do not know my auntquot and very gravely conducted him or her to a little old lady wearing large bows of ribbon in her cap who had come sailing in from another room as soon as the guests began to arrive and slowly turning her eyes from the visitor to her aunt Anna Pavlovna mentioned each one039s name and then left them Each visitor performed the ceremony of greeting this old aunt whom not one of them knew not one of them wanted to know and not one of them cared about Anna Pavlovna observed these greetings with mournful and solemn interest and silent approval The aunt spoke to each of them in the same words about their health and her own and the health of Her Majesty quotwho thank God was better todayquot And each visitor though politeness prevented his showing impatience left the old woman with a sense of relief at having performed a vexatious duty and did not return to her the whole evening The young Princess Bolkonskaya had brought some work in a goldembroidered velvet bag Her pretty little upper lip on which a delicate dark down was just perceptible was too short for her teeth but it lifted all the more sweetly and was especially charming when she occasionally drew it down to meet the lower lip As is always the case with a thoroughly attractive woman her defect mdash the shortness of her upper lip and her halfopen mouth mdash seemed to be her own special and peculiar form of beauty Everyone brightened at the sight of this pretty young woman so soon to become a mother so full of life and health and carrying her burden so lightly Old men and dull dispirited young ones who looked at her after being in her company and talking to her a little while felt as if they too were becoming like her full of life and health All who talked to her and at each word saw her bright smile and the constant gleam of her white teeth thought that they were in a specially amiable mood that day The little princess went round the table with quick short swaying steps her workbag on her arm and gaily spreading out her dress sat down on a sofa near the silver samovar as if all she was doing was a pleasure to herself and to all around her quotI have brought my workquot said she in French displaying her bag and addressing all present quotMind Annette I hope you have not played a wicked trick on mequot she added turning to her hostess quotYou wrote that it was to be quite a small reception and just see how badly I am dressedquot And she spread out her arms to show her shortwaisted lacetrimmed dainty gray dress girdled with a broad ribbon just below the breast quotSoyez tranquille Lise you will always be prettier than anyone elsequot replied Anna Pavlovna quotYou knowquot said the princess in the same tone of voice and still in French turning to a general quotmy husband is deserting me He is going to get himself killed Tell me what this wretched war is forquot she added addressing Prince Vasili and without waiting for an answer she turned to speak to his daughter the beautiful Helene quotWhat a delightful woman this little princess isquot said Prince Vasili to Anna Pavlovna One of the next arrivals was a stout heavily built young man with closecropped hair spectacles the lightcolored breeches fashionable at that time a very high ruffle and a brown dress coat This stout young man was an illegitimate son of Count Bezukhov a wellknown grandee of Catherine039s time who now lay dying in Moscow The young man had not yet entered either the military or civil service as he had only just returned from abroad where he had been educated and this was his first appearance in society Anna Pavlovna greeted him with the nod she accorded to the lowest hierarchy in her drawing room But in spite of this lowestgrade greeting a look of anxiety and fear as at the sight of something too large and unsuited to the place came over her face when she saw Pierre enter Though he was certainly rather bigger than the other men in the room her anxiety could only have reference to the clever though shy but observant and natural expression which distinguished him from everyone else in that drawing room quotIt is very good of you Monsieur Pierre to come and visit a poor invalidquot said Anna Pavlovna exchanging an alarmed glance with her aunt as she conducted him to her Pierre murmured something unintelligible and continued to look round as if in search of something On his way to the aunt he bowed to the little princess with a pleased smile as to an intimate acquaintance Anna Pavlovna039s alarm was justified for Pierre turned away from the aunt without waiting to hear her speech about Her Majesty039s health Anna Pavlovna in dismay detained him with the words quotDo you know the Abbe Morio He is a most interesting manquot quotYes I have heard of his scheme for perpetual peace and it is very interesting but hardly feasiblequot quotYou think soquot rejoined Anna Pavlovna in order to say something and get away to attend to her duties as hostess But Pierre now committed a reverse act of impoliteness First he had left a lady before she had finished speaking to him and now he continued to speak to another who wished to get away With his head bent and his big feet spread apart he began explaining his reasons for thinking the abbe039s plan chimerical quotWe will talk of it laterquot said Anna Pavlovna with a smile And having got rid of this young man who did not know how to behave she resumed her duties as hostess and continued to listen and watch ready to help at any point where the conversation might happen to flag As the foreman of a spinning mill when he has set the hands to work goes round and notices here a spindle that has stopped or there one that creaks or makes more noise than it should and hastens to check the machine or set it in proper motion so Anna Pavlovna moved about her drawing room approaching now a silent now a toonoisy group and by a word or slight rearrangement kept the conversational machine in steady proper and regular motion But amid these cares her anxiety about Pierre was evident She kept an anxious watch on him when he approached the group round Mortemart to listen to what was being said there and again when he passed to another group whose center was the abbe Pierre had been educated abroad and this reception at Anna Pavlovna039s was the first he had attended in Russia He knew that all the intellectual lights of Petersburg were gathered there and like a child in a toyshop did not know which way to look afraid of missing any clever conversation that was to be heard Seeing the selfconfident and refined expression on the faces of those present he was always expecting to hear something very profound At last he came up to Morio Here the conversation seemed interesting and he stood waiting for an opportunity to express his own views as young people are fond of doing CHAPTER III Anna Pavlovna039s reception was in full swing The spindles hummed steadily and ceaselessly on all sides With the exception of the aunt beside whom sat only one elderly lady who with her thin careworn face was rather out of place in this brilliant society the whole company had settled into three groups One chiefly masculine had formed round the abbe Another of young people was grouped round the beautiful Princess Helene Prince Vasili039s daughter and the little Princess Bolkonskaya very pretty and rosy though rather too plump for her age The third group was gathered round Mortemart and Anna Pavlovna The vicomte was a nicelooking young man with soft features and polished manners who evidently considered himself a celebrity but out of politeness modestly placed himself at the disposal of the circle in which he found himself Anna Pavlovna was obviously serving him up as a treat to her guests As a clever maitre d039hotel serves up as a specially choice delicacy a piece of meat that no one who had seen it in the kitchen would have cared to eat so Anna Pavlovna served up to her guests first the vicomte and then the abbe as peculiarly choice morsels The group about Mortemart immediately began discussing the murder of the Duc d039Enghien The vicomte said that the Duc d039Enghien had perished by his own magnanimity and that there were particular reasons for Buonaparte039s hatred of him quotAh yes Do tell us all about it Vicomtequot said Anna Pavlovna with a pleasant feeling that there was something a la Louis XV in the sound of that sentence quotContez nous cela Vicomtequot The vicomte bowed and smiled courteously in token of his willingness to comply Anna Pavlovna arranged a group round him inviting everyone to listen to his tale quotThe vicomte knew the duc personallyquot whispered Anna Pavlovna to of the guests quotThe vicomte is a wonderful raconteurquot said she to another quotHow evidently he belongs to the best societyquot said she to a third and the vicomte was served up to the company in the choicest and most advantageous style like a wellgarnished joint of roast beef on a hot dish The vicomte wished to begin his story and gave a subtle smile quotCome over here Helene dearquot said Anna Pavlovna to the beautiful young princess who was sitting some way off the center of another group The princess smiled She rose with the same unchanging smile with which she had first entered the room mdash the smile of a perfectly beautiful woman With a slight rustle of her white dress trimmed with moss and ivy with a gleam of white shoulders glossy hair and sparkling diamonds she passed between the men who made way for her not looking at any of them but smiling on all as if graciously allowing each the privilege of admiring her beautiful figure and shapely shoulders back and bosom mdash which in the fashion of those days were very much exposed mdash and she seemed to bring the glamour of a ballroom with her as she moved toward Anna Pavlovna Helene was so lovely that not only did she not show any trace of coquetry but on the contrary she even appeared shy of her unquestionable and all too victorious beauty She seemed to wish but to be unable to diminish its effect quotHow lovelyquot said everyone who saw her and the vicomte lifted his shoulders and dropped his eyes as if startled by something extraordinary when she took her seat opposite and beamed upon him also with her unchanging smile quotMadame I doubt my ability before such an audiencequot said he smilingly inclining his head The princess rested her bare round arm on a little table and considered a reply unnecessary She smilingly waited All the time the story was being told she sat upright glancing now at her beautiful round arm altered in shape by its pressure on the table now at her still more beautiful bosom on which she readjusted a diamond necklace From time to time she smoothed the folds of her dress and whenever the story produced an effect she glanced at Anna Pavlovna at once adopted just the expression she saw on the maid of honor039s face and again relapsed into her radiant smile The little princess had also left the tea table and followed Helene quotWait a moment I039ll get my work Now then what are you thinking ofquot she went on turning to Prince Hippolyte quotFetch me my workbagquot There was a general movement as the princess smiling and talking merrily to everyone at once sat down and gaily arranged herself in her seat quotNow I am all rightquot she said and asking the vicomte to begin she took up her work Prince Hippolyte having brought the workbag joined the circle and moving a chair close to hers seated himself beside her Le charmant Hippolyte was surprising by his extraordinary resemblance to his beautiful sister but yet more by the fact that in spite of this resemblance he was exceedingly ugly His features were like his sister039s but while in her case everything was lit up by a joyous selfsatisfied youthful and constant smile of animation and by the wonderful classic beauty of her figure his face on the contrary was dulled by imbecility and a constant expression of sullen selfconfidence while his body was thin and weak His eyes nose and mouth all seemed puckered into a vacant wearied grimace and his arms and legs always fell into unnatural positions quotIt039s not going to be a ghost storyquot said he sitting down beside the princess and hastily adjusting his lorgnette as if without this instrument he could not begin to speak quotWhy no my dear fellowquot said the astonished narrator shrugging his shoulders quotBecause I hate ghost storiesquot said Prince Hippolyte in a tone which showed that he only understood the meaning of his words after he had uttered them He spoke with such selfconfidence that his hearers could not be sure whether what he said was very witty or very stupid He was dressed in a darkgreen dress coat knee breeches of the color of cuisse de nymphe effrayee as he called it shoes and silk stockings The vicomte told his tale very neatly It was an anecdote then current to the effect that the Duc d039Enghien had gone secretly to Paris to visit Mademoiselle George that at her house he came upon Bonaparte who also enjoyed the famous actress039 favors and that in his presence Napoleon happened to fall into one of the fainting fits to which he was subject and was thus at the duc039s mercy The latter spared him and this magnanimity Bonaparte subsequently repaid by death The story was very pretty and interesting especially at the point where the rivals suddenly recognized one another and the ladies looked agitated quotCharmingquot said Anna Pavlovna with an inquiring glance at the little princess quotCharmingquot whispered the little princess sticking the needle into her work as if to testify that the interest and fascination of the story prevented her from going on with it The vicomte appreciated this silent praise and smiling gratefully prepared to continue but just then Anna Pavlovna who had kept a watchful eye on the young man who so alarmed her noticed that he was talking too loudly and vehemently with the abbe so she hurried to the rescue Pierre had managed to start a conversation with the abbe about the balance of power and the latter evidently interested by the young man039s simpleminded eagerness was explaining his pet theory Both were talking and listening too eagerly and too naturally which was why Anna Pavlovna disapproved quotThe means are the balance of power in Europe and the rights of the peoplequot the abbe was saying quotIt is only necessary for one powerful nation like Russia mdash barbaric as she is said to be mdash to place herself disinterestedly at the head of an alliance having for its object the maintenance of the balance of power of Europe and it would save the worldquot quotBut how are you to get that balancequot Pierre was beginning At that moment Anna Pavlovna came up and looking severely at Pierre asked the Italian how he stood Russian climate The Italian039s face instantly changed and assumed an offensively affected sugary expression evidently habitual to him when conversing with women quotI am so enchanted by the brilliancy of the wit and culture of the society more especially of the feminine society in which I have had the honor of being received that I have not yet had time to think of the climatequot said he Not letting the abbe and Pierre escape Anna Pavlovna the more conveniently to keep them under observation brought them into the larger circle CHAPTER IV Just then another visitor entered the drawing room Prince Andrew Bolkonski the little princess039 husband He was a very handsome young man of medium height with firm clearcut features Everything about him from his weary bored expression to his quiet measured step offered a most striking contrast to his quiet little wife It was evident that he not only knew everyone in the drawing room but had found them to be so tiresome that it wearied him to look at or listen to them And among all these faces that he found so tedious none seemed to bore him so much as that of his pretty wife He turned away from her with a grimace that distorted his handsome face kissed Anna Pavlovna039s hand and screwing up his eyes scanned the whole company quotYou are off to the war Princequot said Anna Pavlovna quotGeneral Kutuzovquot said Bolkonski speaking French and stressing the last syllable of the general039s name like a Frenchman quothas been pleased to take me as an aidedecampquot quotAnd Lise your wifequot quotShe will go to the countryquot quotAre you not ashamed to deprive us of your charming wifequot quotAndrequot said his wife addressing her husband in the same coquettish manner in which she spoke to other men quotthe vicomte has been telling us such a tale about Mademoiselle George and Buonapartequot Prince Andrew screwed up his eyes and turned away Pierre who from the moment Prince Andrew entered the room had watched him with glad affectionate eyes now came up and took his arm Before he looked round Prince Andrew frowned again expressing his annoyance with whoever was touching his arm but when he saw Pierre039s beaming face he gave him an unexpectedly kind and pleasant smile quotThere now So you too are in the great worldquot said he to Pierre quotI knew you would be herequot replied Pierre quotI will come to supper with you May Iquot he added in a low voice so as not to disturb the vicomte who was continuing his story quotNo impossiblequot said Prince Andrew laughing and pressing Pierre039s hand to show that there was no need to ask the question He wished to say something more but at that moment Prince Vasili and his daughter got up to go and the two young men rose to let them pass quotYou must excuse me dear Vicomtequot said Prince Vasili to the Frenchman holding him down by the sleeve in a friendly way to prevent his rising quotThis unfortunate fete at the ambassador039s deprives me of a pleasure and obliges me to interrupt you I am very sorry to leave your enchanting partyquot said he turning to Anna Pavlovna His daughter Princess Helene passed between the chairs lightly holding up the folds of her dress and the smile shone still more radiantly on her beautiful face Pierre gazed at her with rapturous almost frightened eyes as she passed him quotVery lovelyquot said Prince Andrew quotVeryquot said Pierre In passing Prince Vasili seized Pierre039s hand and said to Anna Pavlovna quotEducate this bear for me He has been staying with me a whole month and this is the first time I have seen him in society Nothing is so necessary for a young man as the society of clever womenquot Anna Pavlovna smiled and promised to take Pierre in hand She knew his father to be a connection of Prince Vasili039s The elderly lady who had been sitting with the old aunt rose hurriedly and overtook Prince Vasili in the anteroom All the affectation of interest she had assumed had left her kindly and tearworn face and it now expressed only anxiety and fear quotHow about my son Boris Princequot said she hurrying after him into the anteroom quotI can039t remain any longer in Petersburg Tell me what news I may take back to my poor boyquot Although Prince Vasili listened reluctantly and not very politely to the elderly lady even betraying some impatience she gave him an ingratiating and appealing smile and took his hand that he might not go away quotWhat would it cost you to say a word to the Emperor and then he would be transferred to the Guards at oncequot said she quotBelieve me Princess I am ready to do all I canquot answered Prince Vasili quotbut it is difficult for me to ask the Emperor I should advise you to appeal to Rumyantsev through Prince Golitsyn That would be the best wayquot The elderly lady was a Princess Drubetskaya belonging to one of the best families in Russia but she was poor and having long been out of society had lost her former influential connections She had now come to Petersburg to procure an appointment in the Guards for her only son It was in fact solely to meet Prince Vasili that she had obtained an invitation to Anna Pavlovna039s reception and had sat listening to the vicomte039s story Prince Vasili039s words frightened her an embittered look clouded her once handsome face but only for a moment then she smiled again and clutched Prince Vasili039s arm more tightly quotListen to me Princequot said she quotI have never yet asked you for anything and I never will again nor have I ever reminded you of my father039s friendship for you but now I entreat you for God039s sake to do this for my son mdash and I shall always regard you as a benefactorquot she added hurriedly quotNo don039t be angry but promise I have asked Golitsyn and he has refused Be the kindhearted man you always werequot she said trying to smile though tears were in her eyes quotPapa we shall be latequot said Princess Helene turning her beautiful head and looking over her classically molded shoulder as she stood waiting by the door Influence in society however is a capital which has to be economized if it is to last Prince Vasili knew this and having once realized that if he asked on behalf of all who begged of him he would soon be unable to ask for himself he became chary of using his influence But in Princess Drubetskaya039s case he felt after her second appeal something like qualms of conscience She had reminded him of what was quite true he had been indebted to her father for the first steps in his career Moreover he could see by her manners that she was one of those women mdash mostly mothers mdash who having once made up their minds will not rest until they have gained their end and are prepared if necessary to go on insisting day after day and hour after hour and even to make scenes This last consideration moved him quotMy dear Anna Mikhaylovnaquot said he with his usual familiarity and weariness of tone quotit is almost impossible for me to do what you ask but to prove my devotion to you and how I respect your father039s memory I will do the impossible mdash your son shall be transferred to the Guards Here is my hand on it Are you satisfiedquot quotMy dear benefactor This is what I expected from you mdash I knew your kindnessquot He turned to go quotWait mdash just a word When he has been transferred to the Guardsquot she faltered quotYou are on good terms with Michael Ilarionovich Kutuzov recommend Boris to him as adjutant Then I shall be at rest and thenquot Prince Vasili smiled quotNo I won039t promise that You don039t know how Kutuzov is pestered since his appointment as Commander in Chief He told me himself that all the Moscow ladies have conspired to give him all their sons as adjutantsquot quotNo but do promise I won039t let you go My dear benefactorquot quotPapaquot said his beautiful daughter in the same tone as before quotwe shall be latequot quotWell au revoir Goodby You hear herquot quotThen tomorrow you will speak to the Emperorquot quotCertainly but about Kutuzov I don039t promisequot quotDo promise do promise Vasiliquot cried Anna Mikhaylovna as he went with the smile of a coquettish girl which at one time probably came naturally to her but was now very illsuited to her careworn face Apparently she had forgotten her age and by force of habit employed all the old feminine arts But as soon as the prince had gone her face resumed its former cold artificial expression She returned to the group where the vicomte was still talking and again pretended to listen while waiting till it would be time to leave Her task was accomplished CHAPTER V quotAnd what do you think of this latest comedy the coronation at Milanquot asked Anna Pavlovna quotand of the comedy of the people of Genoa and Lucca laying their petitions before Monsieur Buonaparte and Monsieur Buonaparte sitting on a throne and granting the petitions of the nations Adorable It is enough to make one039s head whirl It is as if the whole world had gone crazyquot Prince Andrew looked Anna Pavlovna straight in the face with a sarcastic smile quot039Dieu me la donne gare a qui la touche039 They say he was very fine when he said thatquot he remarked repeating the words in Italian quot039Dio mi l039ha dato Guai a chi la tocchi039quot God has given it to me let him who touches it beware quotI hope this will prove the last drop that will make the glass run overquot Anna Pavlovna continued quotThe sovereigns will not be able to endure this man who is a menace to everythingquot quotThe sovereigns I do not speak of Russiaquot said the vicomte polite but hopeless quotThe sovereigns madame What have they done for Louis XVII for the Queen or for Madame Elizabeth Nothingquot and he became more animated quotAnd believe me they are reaping the reward of their betrayal of the Bourbon cause The sovereigns Why they are sending ambassadors to compliment the usurperquot And sighing disdainfully he again changed his position
